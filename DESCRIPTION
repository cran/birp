Description: A Bayesian tool to test for population trends and changes in trends under arbitrary designs, including before-after (BA), control-intervention (CI) and before-after-control-intervention (BACI) designs commonly used to assess conservation impact. It infers changes in trends jointly from data obtained with multiple survey methods, as well as from limited and noisy data not necessarily collected in standardized ecological surveys. Observed counts can be modeled as following either a Poisson or a negative binomial model, and both deterministic and stochastic trend models are available. For more details on the model see Singer et al. (2025) <doi:10.1101/2025.01.08.631844>, and the file 'AUTHORS' for a list of copyright holders and contributors.
