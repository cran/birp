birp uses the fast-float library by Daniel Lemire _et al_ described in 
<arXiv:2101.11408> and <arXiv:2212.06644> with its code repo at
https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float. The code (v8.0.2) was slightly 
modified to be compatible with CRAN rules and is available at 
https://bitbucket.org/wegmannlab/fast_float/. The fast-float library is
