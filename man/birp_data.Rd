\title{Create a birp_data Object from Count and Effort Matrices}
\usage{
birp_data(counts, efforts, times, CI_groups = NULL, location_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A matrix of observed counts (J locations Ã— K timepoints). Each row corresponds to a location and each column to a timepoint.}

\item{efforts}{A matrix of observation effort with the same dimensions as `counts`.}

\item{times}{A vector of length K specifying the timepoints.}

\item{CI_groups}{A vector of length J specifying the control-intervention (CI) group for each location. Defaults to a single group (`group_1`) if not provided.}

\item{location_names}{Optional names for the locations. Defaults to `"Location_1"`, `"Location_2"`, etc.}
}
\value{
An object of type birp_data
}
\description{
Constructs a 'birp_data' object from matrices of observed counts and corresponding efforts for a single method.
}
\examples{
data <- birp_data(c(10,20,30), c(100,200,300), c(1,2,5))
}
