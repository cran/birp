# README #

Stattools is a C++ library for statistical inference. 
It implements Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Expectation Maximization (EM), 
the Baum-Welch algorithm for Hidden Markov Models (HMM), 
as well as several optimization methods such as Newton-Raphson, Nelder-Mead and line search. 

## Installation ##
To get started, clone the following repository:


    git clone https://madleina@bitbucket.org/wegmannlab/empty-stattools-project.git


This repository implements a simple model using stattools and is an ideal starting point for your own model!
